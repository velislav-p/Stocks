# Stocks
A small project developed for uni, based on a list of requirements. 

It is built as a single page app without using any frameworks. 
It simulates a perpetual stream of stock prices and presents the changes visually.
Communicating with an external API (The WS Journal) and using a JSON file instead of a database were some of the requirements of the project.

Currently working on building this app with AngularJS.
